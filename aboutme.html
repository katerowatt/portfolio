    <h1>Academics...</h1>       
    <p>Hi! My name is Kate Rowatt, and I'm a second year Software Engineering Student at Western University. I fell in love with programming through my high school computer science course, and have known that I wanted to pursue it ever since!</p>
    <p>Another passion of mine includes business. I really enjoyed my different high school business courses, and was actually president of the investment club in grade 12! When I recieved my AEO acceptance letter, I was so excited!! I plan on completing a dual degree with Ivey Business starting next year. </p>
    <h1>My hobbies...</h1>
    <p>Although I have many different passions, my favourite hobby is running. I picked it up through COVID-19, and ever since have found it as a great stress relief for me. This past summer, I actually ran both the Sporting Life 10K, and the Toronto Half Marathon with my sister!</p>
    <h1>My family...</h1>
